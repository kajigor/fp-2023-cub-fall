# Very easy tasks (you can earn no more than 6 points in total)
1. [1 point] Give an example of closed term in normal formal which has type $(\gamma \to \epsilon) \to ((\gamma \to \epsilon) \to \epsilon) \to \epsilon$, but which cannot be typed with the type $\alpha \to (\alpha \to \epsilon) \to \epsilon$.
2. [1 point] Give examples of types having the following powers:
    1) $|a| + |b| * |c| + |b|^2 * |a|$
    2) $|a|^0$
    3) $2 + |a|^{(|b|^{|c|})} * |c|$
    4) $|a|^{(|a|*|b|)} + |b|^{|c|} + c^0 + b^0$
    5) $|a|^{(|b|+|c|)} + 2 + |a|^0$
    6) $|a|^{(|b|*|c|)} + |c|^0$
3. [2 points] Find closed terms in normal form that inhabit type (if any) $(\delta \to \delta \to \alpha) \to (\gamma \to \alpha) \to (\alpha \to \beta) \to \delta \to \gamma \to \beta$ (2 terms; formally prove that they really have the given type)
    1) $(\delta \to \delta \to \alpha) \to (\gamma \to \alpha) \to (\alpha \to \beta) \to \delta \to \gamma \to \beta$
    2) $(\alpha\to(\beta\to\gamma))\to((\alpha\to(\gamma\to\delta))\to(\alpha\to(\beta\to\delta)))$
    3) $((((\alpha\to\beta)\to\alpha)\to\alpha)\to\beta)\to\beta$
    4) $ Void \to Void$
4. [1 point] Give an examples of closed terms in pure lambda calculus:
    1) Term that is strongly normalizing
    2) Term that is weakly normalizing but not strongly normalizing
    3) Typable in system F but not in HM
5. [1 point] Using standat encoding of booleans in lambda calculus evaluate $If\ False\ \Omega\ \lambda x. x$ under call-by-name semantics. What happens when you evaluated it under call-by-value semantics?
6. [2 point] Assume we have a lambda calculus with integers, booleans, conditionals, etc. Consider the following higher-order function $H$.
$H \equiv \lambda f. \lambda n. if\ n = 1\ then\ true\ else\ if\ n = 0\ then\ false\ else\ not\ (f (n − 1))$
    1. Suppose that $g$ is the fixed point of $H$. What does $g$ compute?
    2. Compute $Y\ H$ under call-by-name semantics. What has happened to the function call $f (n − 1)$?
    3. Compute $(Y\ H)\ 2$ under call-by-name semantics. 

# Other tasks

1. [4 points] Write an efficient program that finds the smallest natural number missing in the given set. What is the complexity of our solution?
2. [4 points] Implement real-time dequeue
3. [5 points] Extend STLC with `Unit` being one of the base types. Is there a way of constructing a sequence of terms $t_1 , t_2 , ..., t_n, ...$ in the simply typed lambda-calculus with only the base type `Unit`, such that, for each $n$, the term $t_n$ has size at most $O(n)$ but requires at least $O(2^n)$ steps of evaluation to reach a normal form?
4. [6 points] Implement a type-safe API for for weights (kilograms, pound, pood). Requirements:
    * Three functions that convert a float number to a weight in metric system, royal system, and poods.
    * One function that adds 
    * One function for adding kilograms with kilograms, pounds with pounds and poods with poods.
    * There should be no functions for converting weights to float.
    * A function that will print out the weight in the corresponding dimension.
    * Observe zero-cost abstraction: if one needs to add weights at runtime, then program should add and do nothing else.
5. [5 points] There is another way of computing the predecessor function on Church numerals. Let $k$ stand for the untyped lambda-term $\lambda x. \lambda y. x$ and $i$ for $\lambda x. x$. The untyped lambda-term $vpred = \lambda n. \lambda s. \lambda z. n (\lambda p. \lambda q. q (p s)) (k z) i$ computes the predecessor of an untyped Church numeral. Show that this term can be typed in System F by adding type abstractions and applications as necessary and annotating the bound variables in the untyped term with appropriate types.Explain why it works!
6. [6 points] In pure System F (without fix), write a function insert of type $\forall X. (X \to X \to Bool) \to List X \to X \to List X$ that takes a comparison function, a sorted list, and a new element, and inserts the element into the list at the appropriate point (i.e., after all the elements smaller than it). Next, use insert to build a sorting function for lists in pure System F.
7. [6 points] Prove (in STLC) the permutation lemma : let $\Gamma \vdash t : T$ and $\Delta$ be a permutation of $\Gamma$, then $\Delta \vdash t : T$. Moreover, proove trees has the same size. 
8. [4 points] Extend STLC with `Unit` being one of the base types; equip the calculus with an operator of sequential execution ";" (adding the appropriate evaluation and typing rules)
9. [4 points] Extend STLC with "dummy abstractions (wildcards)", i.e. abstractions $\lambda \_ :\tau . t \equiv \lambda x:\tau . t, x \not\in FV(t)$. Provide the appropriate typing and evaluation rules for it, choosing an arbitrary generally accepted computational strategy.
10. [6 points] Prove (in STLC with `Bool` being one of the base types) Lemma [Canonical Forms]: If `v` is a value of type `Bool`, then `v` is either `True` or `False`.
11. [5 points] Prove the weakening lemma: if $\Gamma \vdash t : T$ and $x \not\in Dom(\Gamma)$, then $\Gamma, x:S \vdash t : T$. Moreover, prove that they have derevation trees of the same size (height).
